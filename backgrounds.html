I am a 5th year architecture student at Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago.
After I finished high school in Morocco I moved to Barcelona where I did my 3 first years
of architecture school at ETSAB Escola TÃ©cnica Superior D'Arquitectura de Barcelona.
Then I transferred in 2013 to Chicago. I have always been interested in the application
of new technologies to architecture as a way to show the audience the ideas that I have
and the spaces that I design. I have done it through videos for the last 6 years, and I am
currently exploring other technologies as VR and projection mapping. Expected graduation
date May 14th 2016. I have the need to show my online portfolio of my architecture projects.
However, I also have a need to share other things that I have done as a product design,
paintings, photography and videos that I have made. I would like my own website/ portfolio
that shows the things I have done (to be hired) and/or create my web identity.Add more
