    <h2><b>MERIEM SAKROUHI</b> </h2>
    <p>
      I am a 5th year architecture student at Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago. I was
born in Rabat, Morocco in 1992. Since I was 4 years old I was in a spanish school until
I graduated from high school. I have been moving to different cities though: Rabat, Tetouan
and Casablanca, where my parents still live now.
    </p>

    <p>
      After I finished high school in Morocco I moved to Barcelona where I did my 3 first years of
architecture school at ETSAB Escola TÃ©cnica Superior D'Arquitectura de Barcelona (Universitat
Politecnica de Catalunya) . Then I transferred in 2013 to Chicago, Illinois. I have always
been interested in the application of new technologies to architecture as a way to show the
audience the ideas that I have in mind and the spaces that I design.

      I have done it through videos for the last 6 years, and I am currently exploring other
technologies as VR and projection mapping. Expected graduation date May 14th 2016.
I have the need to show my online portfolio of my architecture projects.However, I also
have a need to share other things that I have done as a product design, paintings,
photography and videos that I have made. I would like my own website/ portfolio that
shows the things I have done (to be hired) and/or create my web identity.

    <p>
      I speak five languages: arabic and french are my home based languages, I learned spanish
at school as well as living in Spain for 3 years, which is the reason I learned catalan,
I started learning english in high school but got it improved when I moved to the US.

      I practiced a lot of sports when I was in Morocco: started with horse back riding for
seven years, I was on my school soccer team, where we competed against other school
in Morocco, played competitive tennis-which I still play in Chicago- and basketball school
league. I love art, and have done some oil paintings before coming to the US. Lately I have
been more into watercolors and charcoal.

    <p>
      I would love to be able to show my work from the past as ell as an continous updated
collection of my work. It is very importance, in my major to give it a good graphic design
and I am hoping to include photos, plans, graphics and videos that I have made throughout this
 years.
